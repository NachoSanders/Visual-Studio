	<h2>Steve S.</h2> 
	<p>Hello Everyone, my name is Steve! I am currently working on my degree in software development! I enjoy reading books, cooking, and going on hikes. I am very excited for this course as this is something I've always wanted to learn but have never been able to for one reason or another. I am working my way to a bachelors degree but next stop is associates. I cant wait to graduate and am looking forward to working with others in this class!</p>
